  ## Description

  
   I wanted to Utilize express to create a server and be able to send information using routes to be able to put user data onto an application
   It helps solve a way to not use local storage to store data of a user and be able to store data on a local server.
   I learned that Express is a great tool to use when needing to get different pages from user input as well as use data from user input to put into an application.
