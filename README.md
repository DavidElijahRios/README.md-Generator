  ## Description

  
   I wanted to create an application that would allow for a developer to save time in project planning and generate a README.md file effortlessly.
   It helps cutting down the extra time to construct from scratch the layout and set up need for a quality README.md file and rather has a user answer questions that generate the file based off there answers. Any tool that will save a developer time is something truly valuable and essential for maximum efficiency.

  ## Installation
  

  1) Firstly, creating a clone of repository in local machine will need to be done first. 2) After, you will need to go to the location of repository through your Terminal or Bash. 3) next you will need to type in command line 'npm i -y' to install package.json and package-lock.json. 4) Lastly, you will need to type in command line 'npm i inquirer' to install necessary node modules for application to run properly.
  



  ## Usage
  

  Once all necessary packages are installed proceed to type in command line 'node index.js' to initiate the application. Once command is ran, you will then be prompted questions, which at the completion of answering them will generate your README.md file.
